# Search in Rotated Sorted Array - LeetCode Problem

Problem link: https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

## Approach
1. Find the Pivot  
   - Use binary search to find the index where the array rotation occurs.
   - Pivot is the point where `arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]` or `arr[mid] < arr[mid - 1]`.

2. Decide the Search Range 
   - If pivot is `-1`, the array is not rotated â†’ do normal binary search.
   - If `arr[pivot] == target`, return pivot.
   - If target is smaller than `arr[0]`, search in the right half after pivot.
   - Else, search in the left half before pivot.

3. Binary Search  
   - Perform standard binary search in the determined half.

## Complexity
- Time: O(log n) â€” both finding pivot and searching use binary search.
- Space: O(1) â€” no extra space used.

## Code
See `Solution.java` for implementation.
